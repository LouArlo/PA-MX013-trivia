# TRIVIA PROJECT

[TRIVIA](https://laladiaz.github.io/PA-MX013-trivia/)

This was my very first project. Its a trivia game in spanish, where you can choose from two categories of questions.
You can answer each question choosing from a list and at the end you can obtain your score.

This project was built with JavaScript vanilla, HTML and CSS.
